# Customer Behavior Analysis
## Overview
This project explores customer shopping behavior and turns raw data into useful business insights. The work covers data loading in Python, cleaning and EDA, SQL analysis, and building an interactive Power BI dashboard to understand sales trends and customer patterns.

## Dataset
The dataset includes customer purchase details such as product category, payment method, purchase amount, ratings, and basic customer information.

## Tools Used
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server)
* Power BI
* Jupyter Notebook
* GitHub

## Project Steps

1. Data Loading
* Imported the dataset using Pandas
* Checked structure and data types

2. Data Cleaning
* Handled missing values
* Removed duplicates
* Fixed data types

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Analyzed purchase behavior
* Identified top product categories
* Studied payment method usage
* Reviewed rating patterns

4. SQL Analysis
* Wrote queries to generate business insights
* Calculated key metrics
* Created summary views

5. Power BI Dashboard
Built an interactive dashboard showing:
* Sales overview
* Customer segments
* Repeat customer analysis
* Category performance
* Payment distribution


## Key Insights
* Certain product categories drive most revenue
* A few payment methods dominate transactions
* Repeat customers contribute a significant share of sales
* Customer segmentation reveals high-value groups

## How to Run
